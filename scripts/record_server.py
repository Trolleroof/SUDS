"""Recording daemon: owns the arms, the cameras, and the dataset writer, and
exposes recording, an emergency stop, recalibration and live camera streams over
HTTP so the dashboard can drive all of it from buttons.

Why not shell out to `lerobot-record`: that script owns a terminal and takes its
episode boundaries -- and its calibration prompts -- from keyboard listeners,
which a web UI cannot reach. Driving the LeRobot API directly is both simpler and
gives exact control over when an episode is committed.

The interesting part is the commit window. Stopping does *not* immediately write
the episode -- the frames sit in the writer's buffer, and `--commit-seconds`
later the loop saves them. Discarding inside that window is
`clear_episode_buffer()`: instant, and nothing was ever written, so there is no
parquet rewrite and no video re-encode. Walk away and the take is kept, which is
the safe default.

Four things run alongside the recording loop:

*   **E-stop.** `POST /estop` cuts servo torque on both arms from the HTTP
    thread, without waiting for the control loop -- see `_kill_torque`.
*   **Teleop engagement.** The loop starts *observing*: both arms are read and
    the delta is published, but nothing is driven, so bringing the daemon up
    never moves the follower. `POST /engage` hands the follower to the leader
    once the two agree; `POST /disengage` lets go again.
*   **Tracking delta.** Every tick compares the leader's commanded angle against
    the follower's measured angle, per joint. A large delta means the follower is
    fighting something (or is about to). With `--auto-estop` it kills the arms by
    itself.
*   **Calibration.** The LeRobot routine blocks on `input()`; this one is a state
    machine stepped by the loop, so the phases are buttons in the browser.

Hardware is touched under `hw_lock`: the loop holds it for a tick, HTTP handlers
take it for the length of one command. The e-stop is the one caller allowed to
give up on the lock and write anyway.
